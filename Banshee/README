This plugin requires you to patch a trunk build of Banshee.
If you would rather not run banshee from source, or patch your copy
then you should wait for the Banshee 1.4.2 release that should be out
shortly. However if you wish to start testing this plugin sooner rather
than later, apply ``indexer.patch" in your banshee source directory with
$ patch -p0 < indexer.patch

If Banshee fails to build with make, check your pkgconfig (/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/banshee-1-collection-indexer.pc, make the Libs line look like

Libs: -r:${bansheedir}/Banshee.CollectionIndexer.dll
