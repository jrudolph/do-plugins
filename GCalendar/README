==== GCalendar Gnome-Do Plugin ====
I'm still learning, so this might not be the best way, but it's all I've got right now.
If anyone has a better idea of how to handle the GData libs let me know. 
For now I'm just going to Include them in my branch and you can pull them down with the .dll or source.

1. Put the .dll and Google.* in your do plugins directory, they must be in the same directory for the plugin to work.
2. Load Do, on first run the plugin creates two gconf keys in /apps/gnome-do/plugins/gcal. Set your gmail username and password (with @gmail.com).
3. Run do again, you should now be able to search, browse and, create new events with Do.
