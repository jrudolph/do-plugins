Installing the plugin
---------------------
It's annoying when plugin installation is not documented so hopefully this helps. 

Move or copy the bin/Release/ManLookUp.dll to your Gnome-Do Plugins directory and restart Gnome-Do. 

As of this writing, you can install the plugins locally in your ~/.local/share/gnome-do/plugins-0.6.0 directory 
(you might need to change the version number if yours is different). Once you restart Gnome-Do, it should install it automagically.
