There appear to be at least four separate forks of Telepathyâ™¯, and no canonical
upstream.

This code is a fork of the ndesk-ng fork.  The upstream repository, such it is,
can be found at:
git://github.com/nloko/telepathy-sharp.git

This upstream source has been modified for Do:
* NDesk.DBus has been replaced by the (actually maintained!) DBus-Sharp library
* Bare-minimum autotools build system.
