Description
-----------
Generated C# bindings for Telepathy framework
version 0.17.23 of specification. 

Information
-----------
Initially generated by NDesk project telepathy-sharp-ng.
Requires latest development version of NDesk.DBus from
git repository: http://gitweb.ndesk.org/?p=dbus-sharp

Modifications
-------------
* style updates ie. indents, etc.
* added Client namespace due to duplicate IRequest interface
* added MissionControl.cs to support Mission Control D-bus
  interface
* added Mono project *tests* to test bindings

Tests
-----
Included is a Mono project called *tests* in the tests directory.
Main.cs drives the execution. All tests require Empathy to be
online.

There are 3 test classes available:

* MiscTest.cs
* McTest.cs
* DTubeTest.cs

Currently, Main.cs executes DTubeTest.cs. It covers a lot of
things and is the most important test. Once compiled, the 
executable will take up to two arguments. 

Usage: tests.exe account [contact]

The account argument represents the string Mission Control
should use to look up the online connection (ie. jabber0). 
The optional argument, contact, is the contact you wish to 
engage in a D-bus tube with (ie. neil.loknath@jabber.org).

So, if your account jabber0 is tubebuddy@jabber.org 
and you wish to wait for a tube offer, execute 
"tests.exe jabber0" To offer tubebuddy@jabber.org a tube, 
from your account jabber1, execute "tests.exe jabber1 
tubebuddy@jabber.org"

TODO 
----
* finish bindings to MissionControl interface
* more testing
* autotools packaging
