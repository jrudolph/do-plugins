        *** How to use GZip with Mono ***

    Because the Google.GData.Client.GZipStream implementation relies on zlib,
we decided to ship our own compiled version with the library, for both Windows
and Windows Mobile. However, we can't possibly ship binaries for each platform
supported by Mono. Here are the instructions to use GZip with Mono.

    You first need to obtain zlib v1.2.3 (version 1.2.3 is *VERY* important,
it simply WON'T work if you try to use another version) at http://www.zlib.net,
or http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz. Then, issue the following commands:

    $ make clean
    $ ./configure -s
    $ make
    
    This will build libz.so.1.2.3 that will be needed by the library. If you
want you can issue a "make install" to install the library to your library
path. If you don't want to install, just put the libz.so.1.2.3 file in the
same directory as Google.GData.Client.dll.

    That done, you only need to do one last thing, drop the
Google.GData.Client.dll.config file found in clients/cs/misc in the same
directory as Google.GData.Client.dll file.

    Finally, to check everything is alright, run the following:
    
    $ nunit-console2 /fixture=Google.GData.Client.UnitTests.GZipStreamTest\
      unittests.dll
    
    You can also run the tests against the live server (careful to configure
unittests.dll.config before!) using:

    $ nunit-console2 /fixture=Google.GData.Client.LiveTests.GZipTestSuite\
      unittests.dll

    And there you are :)
