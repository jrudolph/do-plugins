The Spreadsheets Sample Application exercises nearly all of the functionality
for the spreadsheets and worksheets feeds and the cells and list feeds.  Use
this sample to see how to QUERY, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE a cell or list entry.

Warning:  There is nearly no exception handling which is ok because this is just
an example. It is highly suggested that you run this in Debug mode, if possible,so you can continue past the exceptions.
